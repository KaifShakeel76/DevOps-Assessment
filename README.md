# Microservices Deployment with Terraform

## Architecture

- **Notification API (ECS/Fargate)**: Receives requests and queues them.
- **Email Sender (ECS/Fargate)**: Processes queued messages and sends emails.
- **AWS App Mesh**: Provides service mesh capabilities.
- **AWS Cloud Map**: Facilitates service discovery.
- **Amazon SQS**: Queues messages between the Notification API and Email Sender.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors the system.

## Deployment Process

1. **Review Microservices**: Understand the Notification API and Email Sender interaction.
2. **Design Deployment**: Strategize considering all requirements.
3. **Create Dockerfiles**: Write Dockerfiles, build, and test Docker images.
4. **Push to Amazon ECR**: Create ECR repositories and push Docker images.
5. **Provision Infrastructure**: Implement using Terraform.
6. **Deploy Services**: Use AWS ECS or Fargate.
7. **Implement Logging**: Ensure logs are sent to CloudWatch.
8. **Configure Auto-Scaling**: Set auto-scaling based on 70% CPU usage.
9. **Configure Health Checks**: Implement and configure health check paths.
10. **Test and Verify**: Ensure system correctness, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## Files and Structure

- `provider.tf`: AWS provider configuration.
- `variables.tf`: Definitions for input variables.
- `main.tf`: Main Terraform configuration.
- `modules/`: Directory containing reusable modules for different components.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the deployment process and architecture.

## CI/CD Pipeline

For bonus points, implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.

## Zero-Downtime Deployment

Propose and implement a strategy for zero-downtime deployments, such as blue-green deployments or canary releases.

## Security

- Implement least-privilege IAM roles.
- Securely store sensitive information using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

## Monitoring

Set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch. Track key metrics such as queue length, processing times, and error rates.
